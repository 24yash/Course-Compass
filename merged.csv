<p><strong>Python for Data Science</strong></p>
<p>This comprehensive course provides a solid foundation in Python programming for data science applications. It covers essential concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and libraries specifically designed for data analysis.</p>
<p>Through hands-on exercises and real-world examples, you&#x27;ll learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read, clean, and manipulate data using NumPy and Pandas</li>
<li>Create visualizations and explore data using Matplotlib and Seaborn</li>
<li>Utilize machine learning algorithms for data modeling and prediction</li>
<li>Leverage cloud-based services for scalable data processing</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon completion of this course, you will be equipped with the skills necessary to leverage Python for data analysis, extracting insights from large datasets, and building data-driven solutions.</p>"
